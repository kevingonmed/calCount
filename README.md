## Overview

**Project Title**:
calCount
**Project Description**:
calCount is a simple Android application built using Jetpack Compose that allows users to input the name of foods and their respective calorie counts, and then tracks the total calorie intake. The app features an easy-to-use interface where users can add food items and their calories, which are then summed up to provide a running total.
**Project Goals**:

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Implement a basic calorie tracking app.
2. Allow users to input food names and calorie values.
3. Update and display the total calories in real-time.
4. Provide a simple and intuitive user interface using Jetpack Compose.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Launch the app.
2. Input the name of the food in the "Name of the food" field.
3. Enter the calorie count for the food in the "Calories" field.
4. Press the "Add Food" button to add the food item and update the total calories.
5. The total calories will be displayed at the bottom of the screen.
